# PHPSignupSystem
## Description
In this project, I have created a signup system in PHP by following a **PHP Beginners Course** by Dani Krossing. This tutorial taught me how to build a user registration system using PHP, MySQL databases, error handlers, and basic security techniques. I also learned about the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern and how to display error messages to users.

The project includes:
- A signup form
- User data validation
- MySQL database integration
- Error handling and security basics

## Features
- User registration and login system
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Use of MySQL to store user data
- Secure password hashing and validation
- MVC architecture implementation
